I have been contemplating ways to share my life and technology experiences while also enhancing my writing skills. Although Wordpress appears to be a quite popular platform for personal blogs, I’d rather not deal with ongoing expenses for servers or disruptions caused by irrelevant technical tasks like virtual machine and database configurations. That’s why using an open source Static Site Generator along with a free web hosting service seems like the ideal approach for me. Here are the tools I used: Hugo: An open source Static Site Generator written in Go that allows you to create fast and flexible websites such as personal blogs, company homepages, galleries and many more. GitHub Pages: A free web hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to host your site directly from your GitHub repository. In the end, I built this site to serve as my personal blog by following the documentations of those tools. I decided to document the entire process as a future reference for myself, and for anyone else, like you, who happens to come across this post by chance.

Sign up an account if you don’t already have one. Create a new repository. Usually, a Pro(paid) account is needed to host site from private repository. Create a public repository if you want to host your site free.1 Push local repository of mysite to GitHub: git remote add origin git@github.com:$GitHubUserName/$RepositoryName.git git branch -M main git push -u origin main Open GitHub repository page. Click on Settings \u003e Pages. Change the Source to GitHub Actions. Create an empty file in local repository. .github/workflows/hugo.yaml Copy and paste the following YAML into the file created in step6. Change the branch name and Hugo version.(If you used the command in step3, the branch name should be main. And Hugo version can be confirmed by running hugo version in Terminal. It is better to use the same version in both local and remote repository.) # Sample workflow for building and deploying a Hugo site to GitHub Pages name: Deploy Hugo site to Pages on: # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch push: branches: - main # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab workflow_dispatch: # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages permissions: contents: read pages: write id-token: write # Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued. # However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete. concurrency: group: \"pages\" cancel-in-progress: false # Default to bash defaults: run: shell: bash jobs: # Build job build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest env: HUGO_VERSION: 0.115.3 steps: - name: Install Hugo CLI run: | wget -O ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v${HUGO_VERSION}/hugo_extended_${HUGO_VERSION}_linux-amd64.deb \\ \u0026\u0026 sudo dpkg -i ${{ runner.temp }}/hugo.deb - name: Install Dart Sass run: sudo snap install dart-sass - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v3 with: submodules: recursive fetch-depth: 0 - name: Setup Pages id: pages uses: actions/configure-pages@v3 - name: Install Node.js dependencies run: \"[[ -f package-lock.json || -f npm-shrinkwrap.json ]] \u0026\u0026 npm ci || true\" - name: Build with Hugo env: # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production HUGO_ENV: production run: | hugo \\ --gc \\ --minify \\ --baseURL \"${{ steps.pages.outputs.base_url }}/\" - name: Upload artifact uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1 with: path: ./public # Deployment job deploy: environment: name: github-pages url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} runs-on: ubuntu-latest needs: build steps: - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages id: deployment uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2 Commit the change to local repository and push to GitHub. Click on Actions from GitHub repository. The orange circle indicates the workflow is running now: After the workflow finished, the indicator will change to a green check. Click on the workflow. the url to mysite will be shown: Click on the url to access mysite that is being hosted by GitHub Pages now. Normally, the URL should be in the format https://$GitHubUsername.github.io/$RepositoryName1. However, I have been using a custom domain which is why my URL is different. From now on, whenever a change is made to this GitHub repository, GitHub will rebuild mysite and deploy the changes. If you have any questions or advice, leave me a comment below and I will try my best to respond! This an indirect way of hosting Hugo site from private repository. ↩︎ ","date":"Wed, Jul 19, 2023","objectID":"/posts/how-to-create-a-personal-blog-using-hugo-and-github-pages/:5:0","series":null,"tags":["Hugo","GitHub","GitHub Pages"],"title":"How to Create a Free Personal Blog Using Hugo and GitHub Pages","uri":"/posts/how-to-create-a-personal-blog-using-hugo-and-github-pages/#host-on-github-pages"},{"categories":null,"content":"Hello.
